The gaps in this table are versioned. This means that open gaps are closed by inserting a new row with different timestamp (𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 field).
Thus, two rows with the same 𝗴𝗮𝗽_𝗶𝗱 can coexist: one for the previous open gap and one for the current closed gap.
The 𝗴𝗮𝗽_𝗶𝗱 is MD5 hash of [𝘀𝘀𝘃𝗶𝗱, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗽, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝗹𝗮𝘁, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝗹𝗼𝗻].
