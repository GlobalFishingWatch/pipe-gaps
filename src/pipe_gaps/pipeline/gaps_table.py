𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆
Each row in this table is created when the period of time between two consecutive AIS positions from a single vessel exceeds {min_gap_length} hours.
When the period of time between last known position and the last time of the current day exceeds {min_gap_length} hours, we create an open gap.
In that case, the gap will not have a 𝗲𝗻𝗱_𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗽, until it is closed in the future when new data arrives.

The gaps in this table are versioned. This means that open gaps are closed by inserting a new row with different timestamp (𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 field).
Thus, two rows with the same 𝗴𝗮𝗽_𝗶𝗱 can coexist: one for the previous open gap and one for the current closed gap.
The 𝗴𝗮𝗽_𝗶𝗱 is MD5 hash of [𝘀𝘀𝘃𝗶𝗱, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗽, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝗹𝗮𝘁, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁_𝗹𝗼𝗻].

𝗖𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘀
⬖ Gaps are generated based on 𝘀𝘀𝘃𝗶𝗱 so a single gap can refer to two different 𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗹_𝗶𝗱.
⬖ Gaps are generated based on position messages that are filtered by 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱_𝘀𝗲𝗴𝟮 field of the segments table in order to remove noise.
⬖ Gaps are generated based on position messages that are not filtered by not 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴_𝗮𝗻𝗱_𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁 field of the segments table.
